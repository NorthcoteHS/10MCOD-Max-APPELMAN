#### Variable names

Same convention as file names - short, descriptive, uses camel case, and only letters and numbers. Example:

```python
firstName = 'Bob'

## Steps

1. Start by refreshing your personal repo with the latest commits from 10MCOD. In Brackets:
    - Open the Git extension, click the "origin" button near the right, and choose "upstream".
    - Hit the "Git Pull" button, which should show multiple available pulls.
    - When finished, return the first button to the "origin" setting.
2. From pulling, you will now have *this module* on your computer! Open the folder to view the files.
    - Use the "File Tree" on the left in Brackets to find `modules/u3/naming/`.
    - Right-click on the folder and choose "Show in Explorer".
3. Fix the folder structure of the files in `naming` and commit.
    - In this case we don't want any folders. Move all files to the root level of `naming`.
    - Remember to use a meaningful commit message.
4. Fix all file names and file extensions (to .py) and commit.
    - Don't change README.md!
    
5. Check each file's docstring and update any invalid fields, then commit.
    - Replace "Student Name" with your own name.
    - Adjust all dates to use YYYY-MM-DD format.
6. Complete the Debugging, Complete The Code, and Commenting programs that you find, and commit.
8. When completely done, push your progress to GitHub!
    - Remember that you needed to  set your remote back to "origin" at the end of Step 1.
